# 🗨️ Simple Chat App | My First React Native App with Expo

This is my very first mobile app project built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/). It's a simple chat application using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authentication and real-time message storage.  
The goal behind this project was to get hands-on experience and start my journey in mobile app development. Just the beginning! 🚀
